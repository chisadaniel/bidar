                            Also, this Web system will suggest related information and/or knowledge according to each user profile and a set of given areas/topics of interest

                            Linked Data Principle
                        </h2>
                        <div class="card-body">
                            <p>The term Linked Data refers to a set of best practices for publishing structured data on the Web. These principles have been coined by Tim Berners-Lee in the design issue note Linked Data.</p>
                            <p>It builds upon standard Web technologies such as HTTP, RDF and URIs, but rather than using them to serve web pages only for human readers, it extends them to share information in a way that can be read automatically by computers. Part of the vision of linked data is for the Internet to become a global database.
                                Linked data may also be open data, in which case it is usually described as linked open data (LOD). <br/> The priciples are:
                            </p>
                            <ul class="list-group mb-2">
                                <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-action list-group-item-secondary">Use URIs as names for things</li>
                                <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-action list-group-item-secondary">Use HTTP URIs so that people can look up those names.</li>
                                <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-action list-group-item-secondary">When someone looks up a URI, provide useful information</li>
                                <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-action list-group-item-secondary">Include links to other URIs. so that they can discover more things.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                The idea behind these principles is on the one hand side, to use standards for the representation and the access to data on the Web. On the other hand, the principles propagate to set hyperlinks between data from different sources. These hyperlinks connect all Linked Data into a single global data graph,
                                similar as the hyperlinks on the classic Web connect all HTML documents into a single global information space. Thus, LinkedData is to spreadsheets and databases what the Web of hypertext documents is to word processor files. The Linked Open Data cloud diagramms give an overview of the linked data sets that are available on the Web.
                            </p>
                            <p>Tim Berners-Lee later restated these principles at a 2009 TED conference, again paraphrased along the following:</p>
                            <ul class="list-group mb-2">
                                <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-action list-group-item-secondary">All conceptual things should have a name starting with HTTP.</li>
                                <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-action list-group-item-secondary">Looking up an HTTP name should return useful data about the thing in question in a standard format.</li>
                                <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-action list-group-item-secondary">Anything else that that same thing has a relationship with through its data should also be given a name beginning with HTTP.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h5>Linked open data</h5>
                            <p>Linked open data are linked data that are open data. Tim Berners-Lee gives the clearest definition of linked open data in differentiation with linked data.
                                "Linked Open Data (LOD) is Linked Data which is released under an open license, which does not impede its reuse for free." — Tim Berners-Lee, Linked Data</p>
                            <p>Large linked open data sets include DBpedia and Wikidata.</p>
                            <p>Tim Berners-Lee has suggested a 5-star scheme for grading the quality of open data on the web, for which the highest ranking is Linked Open Data:</p>
                            <ul class="list-group mb-2">
                                <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-action list-group-item-secondary">1 star: data is openly available in some format. </li>
                                <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-action list-group-item-secondary">2 stars: data is available in a structured format, such as Microsoft Excel file format (.xls).</li>
                                <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-action list-group-item-secondary">3 stars: data is available in a non-proprietary structured format, such as Comma-separated values (.csv).</li>
                                <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-action list-group-item-secondary">4 stars: data follows W3C standards, like using RDF and employing URIs.</li>
                                <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-action list-group-item-secondary">5 stars: all of the other, plus links to other Linked Open Data sources.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>The goal of the W3C Semantic Web Education and Outreach group's Linking Open Data community project is to extend the Web with a data commons by publishing various open datasets as RDF on the Web and by setting RDF links between data items from different data sources. In October 2007, datasets consisted of over two billion RDF triples, which were interlinked by over two million RDF links.
                                By September 2011 this had grown to 31 billion RDF triples, interlinked by around 504 million RDF links. A detailed statistical breakdown was published in 2014.

                            <p>Ontologies are formal descriptions of data structures. Some of the better known ontologies are:</p>
                            <ul class="list-group mb-2">
                                <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-action list-group-item-secondary">FOAF – an ontology describing persons, their properties and relationships</li>

                                        The application front-end will be implemented in Vue.js and will be styled with bootstrap. The data will be extracted through AJAX requests and rendered in different pages to be used in different scenarios such as filtering, searching, customizing etc.

                                        <h4>Authentication service</h4>
                                        <p>
                                            This service will check the user's credentials in order to make sure he is an already existing customer of the platform.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            From a technical point of view, this service will work using JWT token. The front-end, will make, on behalf of the user a 'log-in'
                                            request to this service, and the said service will check the credentials, and if they are fine(that is, this user's credentials are already present in the database)
                                            then it will generate a JWT token for the user and send it back to him in the response's payload.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            This JWT token will keep, besides an validity timeframe, metadata about the user like: the geographical location, its name etc and the preferences it has selected in the frontend UI.

                                                The said endpoints will provide a REST interface that the front-end component can interact with through HTTP calls in order to allow the user to interact with the web application.

                                                Furthermore, all the requests that will be made to this service will be checked for the JWT token that is mandatory.
                                                In case the token isn't present, the request will be rejected.

                                            <h5>Functionality</h5>
                                            <p>
                                                One of the features that will be provided by this service is the ability of retrieving, from the database, all the information of interest for the user based on it's metadata and interests.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                Another feature provided by this service is represented by the comparison capabilities between two sets of content returned by the data source.
                                                Basically, the service will retrieve the right data for the two input and generate a difference between them.
                                                The response will contain the differences between the two resources.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                To retrieve the data, this service will make send sparql queries to some sparql endpoints exposed by the sources from which the data will be gathered.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                This service will take into account the reliability and fault tolerance of the sparql endpoints that are exposed and queried when a request gets processed.
                                                Therefor, the application will attempt a retry if a request to the dbpedia's endpoints fails.
                                            </p>

                                        <p>
                                            This service will expose a set of endpoints that will be called by the front end in order to allow the user to manage its profile and data.
                                            The endpoints exposed by this service, which will be called by the front end application, the user will be able to:
                                        <ul class="list-group">
                                        <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-action list-group-item-secondary">1. Change its personal data, like: first name, last name, location</li>
                                        <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-action list-group-item-secondary">2. In what language he wants the results to be displayed</li>
                                        <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-action list-group-item-secondary">3. Add, remove or update its area of interest</li>
                                        <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-action list-group-item-secondary">4. Add, remove or update its area of skills</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        All this service's input will be validated for correctness(basically, the skills, interests and so on should be choosen from a predfined liet displayed by the frontend application)
                                        As with the other services, each request will be validated by checking that the JWT token is present in it.
                                        </p>

                                    Java is the main programming language that is going to be used to implement the said services.
                                    By running on the platform the Java language provides, all the services that make up the backend side of the application
                                    are able to reap the benefits of all the libraries and frameworks that already exist, and increase their reliability, security and performance by doing so.

                                    Vue.js is an open-source model–view–viewmodel front end JavaScript framework for building user interfaces and single-page applications. It was created by Evan You, and is maintained by him and the rest of the active core team members.
                                    Vue.js features an incrementally adaptable architecture that focuses on declarative rendering and component composition. The core library is focused on the view layer only. Advanced features required for complex applications such as routing, state management and build tooling are offered via officially maintained supporting libraries and packages. <br/>
                                    Vue.js allows for extending HTML with HTML attributes called directives. The directives offer functionality to HTML applications, and come as either built-in or user defined directives.
